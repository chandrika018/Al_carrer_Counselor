🎯 AI_Career_Counselor for Rural Youth


📌 Project Overview
The AI Career Counselor for Rural Youth is an intelligent virtual assistant designed to provide personalized career guidance to students in rural areas. It bridges the gap caused by limited access to career counseling, helping youth explore job opportunities, online courses, government schemes, and vocational training.

🚀 Features
Personalized career guidance based on user interests

Information on job-oriented courses and government programs

Support for both Hindi and English

Easy-to-use chatbot interface for mobile and web

Career path suggestions based on educational background

🎯 Objective
To empower rural youth by providing AI-driven career counseling, enhancing awareness, and helping them make informed decisions about their future.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python / Node.js (backend)

OpenAI API (AI chatbot logic)

React / HTML-CSS-JS (frontend UI)

Firebase / MongoDB (database)

GitHub Pages / Vercel (deployment)

🧠 How It Works
The user interacts with the chatbot through text or voice.

The AI counselor asks basic questions (education, interests, goals).

Based on the inputs, it recommends career paths, courses, and local opportunities.

It also shares links to training platforms like NSDC, Skill India, and government job portals.

📈 Impact
Improved access to career guidance in rural communities

Increased awareness of digital learning tools and job platforms

Encouragement for self-growth and informed career planning
